Project to create a better understanding of how OOP Principles work.

## OOP
- Inheritance to me is like genes having properties from something else to make the new thing.
- Abstraction to me is an porperty that you have to fill in the blank by the time you hit a concrete class. You have to set a value.
- Polymorphism is having a value already set in place but can change or keep the value you decide.
- Encapsulation is like saying hey you can swim but you have to be in the swimming area.
